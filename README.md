# W&M 2021 iGEM Mechanistic Model

Code for the [model described here](https://2021.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Model). This is strongly based off of the model developed by Andrea Weisse (Weisse et al., 2015) by starting with a base set of equations describing concentrations of particles and proteins used in metabolically relevant processes in a host E. Coli cell, and extended the inclusion of specific genes most consistently associated with differential gene expression, as well as a coarse-grained model of the heat shock response.
